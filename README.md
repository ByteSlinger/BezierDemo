# BezierDemo
Apple IOS Xcode Bezier Path demo

This Objective C demo shows how to use Bezier paths to create a few geometric shapes.

Here are the highlights of this demo:

1) Uses a UIPickerView to control which shape to draw
2) Uses CAShapeLayer to display each shape
3) Fills each shape with a color and outlines it with a small black border
4) Displays a CATextLayer in the center with the name of the selected shape
5) Uses a CAShapeLayer of a white rounded rectangle as the background for the text
6) Uses 10 lines to outline double ended arrows
